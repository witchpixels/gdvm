# gdvm
A CLI Version manager for godot

The tools for managing multiple godot versions that I've seen are all gui based. Which, while nice for some, I prefer to
be able to have something that is more shell integrated, and also that manages the environment variables and path for
other tools that rely on the current godot version being in path (notably the godot tools for vscode).

**This is not ready for any kind of use and I will not provide any support for it at this time**
